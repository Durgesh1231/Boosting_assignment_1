        "# Boosting is an ensemble technique in machine learning where weak learners (usually decision trees) are trained sequentially.\n",
        "# Each subsequent model focuses on the errors made by the previous model. The goal is to combine these weak learners into\n",
        "# a strong learner that performs well on complex datasets. Boosting helps improve the accuracy of the model by reducing bias.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q2. What are the advantages and limitations of using boosting techniques?\n",
        "\n",
        "# Advantages:\n",
        "# 1. Boosting can significantly improve the predictive accuracy compared to individual models.\n",
        "# 2. It helps in reducing both bias and variance.\n",
        "# 3. Boosting is less prone to overfitting than other techniques such as bagging, especially with the proper choice of regularization.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Limitations:\n",
        "# 1. Boosting can be computationally expensive and time-consuming due to the sequential nature of the models.\n",
        "# 2. It is sensitive to noisy data and outliers. Misclassification of these outliers can affect the performance of the model.\n",
        "# 3. The model can be prone to overfitting if too many estimators (trees) are used or if the learning rate is not tuned well.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q3. Explain how boosting works?\n",
        "# In boosting, models are trained sequentially. The first model trains on the original dataset.\n",
        "# After each subsequent model is trained, it places more emphasis on the misclassified instances from previous models.\n",
        "# This approach gradually \"boosts\" the accuracy of the ensemble by combining multiple weak models (typically decision trees).\n",
        "# The final model is a weighted average or majority vote of all the individual models.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q4. What are the different types of boosting algorithms?\n",
        "# 1. AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)\n",
        "# 2. Gradient Boosting\n",
        "# 3. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)\n",

        "# 1. n_estimators: The number of boosting rounds or iterations.\n",
        "# 2. learning_rate: The step size shrinking the contribution of each model.\n",
        "# 3. max_depth: The maximum depth of each weak learner (tree).\n",
        "# 4. subsample: The fraction of samples used for fitting each individual base learner.\n",
        "# 5. loss: The loss function used to optimize the model.\n",

        "# Q6. How do boosting algorithms combine weak learners to create a strong learner?\n",
        "# Boosting algorithms train weak learners sequentially, with each learner trying to correct the errors made by the previous one.\n",
        "# The final strong learner is a weighted combination of these weak learners. Each learner contributes more or less depending on\n",
        "# its accuracy in the previous iterations. The model weights the errors of misclassified samples, forcing the algorithm to focus\n",

        "\n",
        "# Q7. Explain the concept of AdaBoost algorithm and its working.\n",
        "# AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is a type of boosting algorithm that adjusts the weights of incorrectly classified data points.\n",
        "# In AdaBoost, initially, each data point is given equal weight. After each iteration, misclassified data points are given more weight,\n",
        "# so the next model pays more attention to those hard-to-classify instances. The final model is a weighted sum of the predictions from\n",

        "# L = exp(-y * f(x)), where y is the true label, and f(x) is the predicted output of the model.\n",

        "# Q9. How does the AdaBoost algorithm update the weights of misclassified samples?\n",
        "# In AdaBoost, after each iteration, the weights of the misclassified samples are increased. This ensures that the subsequent\n",
        "# model pays more attention to these examples. The weight update rule is as follows:\n",
        "# 1. For correctly classified samples, the weight is multiplied by exp(-alpha), where alpha is the model's weight in the ensemble.\n",
        "# 2. For misclassified samples, the weight is multiplied by exp(alpha), where alpha is the weight of the misclassified model.\n",
